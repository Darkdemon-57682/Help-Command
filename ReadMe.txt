If your interested I stream on Twitch some GTA RP you should come and hang out sometime https://www.twitch.tv/darkdemon57682

Installation:
Step 1:Downlaod the file(obviousley)
Step 2:Take the HelpScript file and put it into your server resources folder
Step 3:Go to your server.cfg file and edit and then add ensure/start HelpScript
Note:If the other scripts in your server.cfg say start then you would put start and then HelpScript and Vice Versa
Note:Make sure if you chnage the name of the script folder make it have no spaces -'s are an ecxeption

I do not have anything to do with your game crashing this script has been fully tested however if you need help then contact me via CFX

Configure the message the script sends in game by going to the "help-c.lua file and editing and where it says msg("")put the message that you wish to relay inside of the qoutations E.G:msg("Hello There General Kenobi")

This is my first script i have ever made im sorry if its not perfect but i tried my best thank you for understanding
